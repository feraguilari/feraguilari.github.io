summary: Classification of Online Session Behavior using Machine Learning Categorization Models.
---

For this project I used the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset which contains information about website visitors and their behavior on the site. This dataset tracks the user as revenue generating or not. The aim of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify a user as revenue generating or not given his behavior when visiting the website. Having an efficient model is imperative, since it will be tracking the users' behavior in real time to predict if the session will generate revenue. With the use of this predictive model, a marketing strategy could be deployed in order to induce the user to generate revenue or to incentivize revenue generating behavior during the session.
