summary: Hypothesis testing on Northwind's Database using SQL queries to obtain Business intelligence.
---

The goal is to find strategies that will increase Northwind's profits, hence, I will be looking into solutions that either increase revenue or cut down costs. The following questions will be answered throughout the notebook, each with its own section stating its null and alternate hypothesis, and performing hypothesis testing to verify the significance of the findings. This will enable me to provide Northwind with relevant recommendations in how to improve their operations to obtain a higher profit.
