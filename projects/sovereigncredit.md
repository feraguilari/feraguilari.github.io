I had the opportunity to attend a hackathon organized by The World Bank to explore new ways of extracting valuable insight from their data that would contribute towards their mission. The World Bank's mission is "to achieve the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and building shared prosperity".

The World Bank like any other banking institution has limited resources, and the efficient allocation of these resources is crucial to achieving the bank's goals. With various countries competing for financing options to improve their countries, how do we choose go gets the resources they need?

In this project, I look into country governance indicators and how they impact the country's risk of default as rated by independent sovereign debt credit agency's. The main question to be answered is, how are government indicators associated with risk of default?
