<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="https://medium.com/@feraguilari/histograms-in-data-science-fdb30af97e21">Histograms in Data Science</a></h4><p> Histograms resemble vertical bar charts. However, histograms depict the underlying frequency of a set of discrete or continuous data that are measured on an interval scale. This depiction makes it easy to visualize the underlying distribution of the dataset, and inspect for other properties such as skewness and kurtosis.</p></blockquote>
